## 🌍 The Global Infrastructure for Autonomous Agents

ProxyBase is an API-first, fully headless SOCKS5 proxy brokerage designed exclusively for **autonomous AI agents, scrapers, and machine-to-machine (M2M) workflows**. 

By blending our **proprietary B2C mobile residential network** with aggregated **Tier-1 B2B partner networks**, ProxyBase delivers high-concurrency, dynamically routed IP infrastructure that operates on a massive global scale. No matter where your AI swarms need to go, ProxyBase ensures they get there—unblocked, undetected, and uninterrupted.

## ⚡ Why Top AI Orchestrators Choose ProxyBase

### 🤖 100% Headless & AI-Native
Throw away the clunky web dashboards. ProxyBase is managed entirely via REST, gRPC, and our native [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Your AI agents can provision, utilize, automatically rotate IPs, and pay for their own infrastructure—zero human intervention required.

### 🎯 Intent-Based Dynamic Routing
Our intelligent routing allows agents to dynamically request IP features on the fly. Simply append your intent to the SOCKS5 authentication string (e.g., `jwt|country_US|type_mobile`) and our edge gateways immediately fulfill the precise geographic or bandwidth request. 

### 🛡️ Ironclad Global Reliability (Hybrid Supply Chain)
We don't rely on a single point of failure. Our dual-pronged strategy ensures maximum availability:
- **Tier 1 (Proprietary Mobile Fleet):** Highly trusted, authentic mobile and residential IPs sourced directly from our global consumer app footprint.
- **Tier 2 (B2B Aggregation):** Seamless fallback to established wholesale partner networks. If one route is congested, our SOCKS5-to-SOCKS5 bridge instantly shifts traffic to ensure a 99.99% success rate.

### 🏎️ Extreme Concurrency & Performance
Built from the ground up in memory-safe **Rust**, our edge infrastructure is optimized to handle the massive TCP/UDP handshake churn inherent to AI swarms. Utilizing advanced stream multiplexing (smux/yamux), ProxyBase easily routes hundreds of distinct agent requests through a single reverse tunnel with near-zero latency.

### 💸 Borderless M2M Crypto Payments
A truly autonomous system must be able to fund itself. ProxyBase features native integration with NOWPayments, allowing orchestrators and AI agents to pay for bandwidth dynamically using **USDT, BTC, ETH**, and other major cryptocurrencies. As soon as a payment is confirmed on the blockchain, proxies are provisioned and webhooks instantly awaken your agents.

### 📡 Instant Telemetry & Self-Healing Swarms
Don't wait for a scrape to fail. ProxyBase provides real-time webhook events for IP burn rates and low byte-balances, empowering your AI orchestrators to instantly rotate IPs or top-up bandwidth automatically.

## 🛠️ Built for the Next Generation of AI

Whether you are scaling an open-source web scraper, managing a swarm of data collection agents, or developing custom WebRTC, UDP, and raw TCP protocols, **ProxyBase is the solid foundation your infrastructure needs.**
